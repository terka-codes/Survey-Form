# freeCodeCamp Survey Form

❊ This was my **first project** since I started to learn how to code. I used **only HTML and CSS**, all without any frameworks and libraries. <br />
❊ I wanted to challange my skilss by building functional survey. <br />
❊ The design of this project is in **the retro style**, which I demonstrated with the font, colors, and the box shadows. <br />
❊ The design is responsive, and I have also included navigational buttons with little animations. <br />
